# Transcribe
 - A tool to transcribe audio files and correct errors

 -Things to consider:
 * Once a list is sent for processing, sending more lists will create additional threads. This behavior will be addressed in the future updates, where the new lists will be queued.
 * Search functionality does not work yet.

 * After the audio file is processed and a csv is created, do not rename or change the directory of the files. Let them be in the same directory.

 * If CSV is to be imported manually, make sure to have the audio file with the same name in the same directory.

 * Editor:
 * Before changing the threshold value, make sure to save the changes
